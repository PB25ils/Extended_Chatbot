    Basically, the Grid-drawing method is one of the most well-known 
    drawing techniques where you apply the same grid to both your canvas
    and the reference. This way, you can copy proportions and details
    from the reference accurately.

    It is particularly useful for solving scaling issues and helps
    improve your observational skills.

    The outcomes are very different. As mentioned before, this is a
    DRAWING TECHNIQUE that helps you draw easier and more efficiently.
    Simply looking at a reference with our eyes has limitations in
    capturing details and proportions.

    Grid-drawing fixes that by allowing you to focus on small 
    sections at a time. This makes it especially helpful when 
    drawing in a different scale than the reference.

    Like its name suggests, you apply the same grid on your canvas or paper
    as your reference. Then, start by observing each box and outlining
    larger shapes. Keep your pencil pressure light to avoid difficulty
    in erasing mistakes.

    While the reference should have clear grid lines, your drawing 
    should be lightly gridded to avoid affecting the final result.
